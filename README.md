# Kickstarter Analysis

## *Data Analysis for Kickstarter Campaigns*

This project is part of the homework assignments for the Data Analytics Boot Camp which I started on March 1st, 2020

All the Data Analysis was done using MS-Excel since as of today Excel is still one the most popular tools for data analysis and, as such, it is very important to know its scopes and limitations

Project finished and ready for submission on March 8th, 2020
